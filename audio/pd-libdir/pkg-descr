The 'libdir' loader is a Pure Data loader which supports the libdir library
format. The libdir library format aims to be a common library format for Pd
which works with objects written in any language, including Pd. This library
format was designed to be easy to create, install, and use. It should work when
installed into the global path (i.e. pd/extra) or when copied locally into a
project folder. It should work with objects written in any supported language
(i.e. binaries, .pd, and the various loaders like pdlua and tclpd).
