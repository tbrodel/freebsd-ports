pd-lua adds a new loader to Pure Data (Pd), that allows one to load
objectclasses written in the popular lua programming language.

Some programming problems are complicated to express in graphical dataflow
languages like Pd, requiring the user to ressort to objectclasses written in
more general purpose languages. For those who do not want to use compiled
languages like C/C++, this package offers the possibility to write first-class
objectclasses in the lightweight programming language "lua".
