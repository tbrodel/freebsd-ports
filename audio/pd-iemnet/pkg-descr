This is a re-implementation of the original pd-net library by Martin Peach,
focussing on reliability and performance.

This library adds Pure Data objects that allow one to build a networking
infrastructure within Pd on OSI-Layer 4 (transport layer). The objects use
threads to allow for non-blocking network communication within an audio-realtime
environment.

[tcpreceive], [tcpsend]: unidirectional communication over TCP/IP [tcpserver],
[tcpclient]: bidirectional communication over TCP/IP [udpreceive], [udpsend]:
unidirectional communication over UDP [udpclient]: bidirectional communication
over UDP

Since these objects only send/receive lists of bytes, you will most likely need
to add some glue to implement higher-level protocols (and transmit meaningful
data).
