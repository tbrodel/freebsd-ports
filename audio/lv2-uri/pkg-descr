This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to integers,
usually for performance reasons (e.g. processing events typed by URIs in real
time). The expected use case is for plugins to map URIs to integers for things
they 'understand' at instantiation time, and store those values for use in the
audio thread without doing any string comparison. This allows the extensibility
of RDF with the performance of integers (or centrally defined enumerations).
