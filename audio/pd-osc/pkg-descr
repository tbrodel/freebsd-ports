This library allows one to construct and parse OSC messages within Pd. It
includes support for ordinary OSC-messages, typetags, timetags and bundles.

These objects are transport-agnostic, so you can use them to transmit OSC over
UDP, TCP/IP, serial port, or in fact whatever you want. However, you will have
to install additional libraries that will handle the transport layer (like
pd-iemnet or pd-comport).
